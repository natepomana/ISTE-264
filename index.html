            <h2>HW1 - Introduction of Loading.js</h2>
            <p>Members: Nate Pomana.</p>
            <hr/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Goals of the project / What's the problem?</h3> 
            <h5>Loading times can vary depending on different variables such as device, internet connection, and location. Most sites don't have some form of loading screen to show that the site is actually loading. Instead, users may be staring at a blank screen or a partially loaded webpage. This is a problem because users may leave the page, or spend time trying to debug the problem, when in reality their site is loading and it's just taking some amount of time. If a loading screen, such as a wheel, was shown on a webpage, this could prevent users from deviating from the site and spengind time debugging a problem that is not necessarially a problem.</h5> 
            <br/>
            <h3>Target Analysis</h3>
            <h5>Potentially anyone could use this product, but specifically, those who are not patient.</h5>
            <br/>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <h5>This should NOT be used as a solution to all loading problems. The intent is to give a visual for users to look at as a website is loading. Loading.js won't make a site suddenly load quicker, but offer a visual for users to look at. If a user is looking at motion, there is a chance they may stay. I don't have any proof of this which is what I want to examine also with this.</h5>
            <br/>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <h5>People are impatient. We go on websites that show some sort of "loading" mechanism - just a blank white screen. What if there was a way for developers, and potentially users, to use and see a loading animation? Enter Loading.js, a plugin to offer developers the ability to implement loading animations with a small file size.</h5>
            <h5>Since this is still in development, Loading.js could be a chrome extension for users to download and use. Developers could use Loading.js if it was a library to create and use premade "loaders".</h5>
            <br/>
            <h3>The Plan</h3>
            <h5>View other "loader" options, whether frameworks, Chrome Extensions, or implementations of them.</h5>
            <h5>Do comparison with sample users of two sites - one that has no loading animation, and the other with a loader animation. Compare reactions/wait time/patience of users.</h5>
            <h5>Based on that, create sample loaders for developers to use. The sample loaders could be easily copied and pasted into developer's code and would work.</h5>
            <h5>After more thought, Loading.js may become a Library for developers to use to create/use loading animations. Developers could select a certain style, colors, speed, size, and potentially other variables.</h5>

        <h2>HW2 - Lo-Fi Prototyping</h2>
        <hr/>
        <br/>
        <h3>The Process</h3> 
        <h5>Before I began creating lo-fi prototypes, I wanted to take a step back and look at the Key User Interface Heuristics, and see what I could incorporate into Loading.js. From the 10, I decided to focus on:</h5> 
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Visibility of system status</li>
            <li>Consistency and standards</li>
            <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
            <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
            <li>Manage errors</li>
            <li>Help and documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <h5>From here, I prototyped samples of loading animations, but two stuck out the most to me - a circle spinning and the wave.</h5>
        <br/>
        <h3>The Circle</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"></div>
            <div class="col-8">
                <img src="src/img/lo_proto_circle.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
                <h5>The circle animation is extremely flexible. It can be created as either a minimalist thin design, or as a heavier, thicker design. This can be decided by the developer as what would match best with the company. Possibly, instead of a ring, a dot or segment could travel in a circle, again showing a minimalist design.</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="col"></div>
        </div>
        
        <br/>
        <h3>The Wave</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"></div>
            <div class="col-8">
                <img src="src/img/lo_proto_wave.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
                <h5>
                    The wave animation would also be a minimalist design, and flexible of use. A developer could edit the speed of which the wave action happens. If they want a simpler wave, there could be a dot wave. more weight? a line wave. I want the developer to have full control to edit and manipulate the animation to match what the product of the site that this would be going on.
