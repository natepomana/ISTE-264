## Documentation
This sample documentation is for the Hi-Fi Prototype, of what a sample circle's documentation would look like.

__Loading.js - Circle__

Sample Code
```javascript
$('#loading').loading({
        type: 'circle',
        size: '150px',
        colors: ['#eee','#222'],
        speed: 1,
        weight: '2px'
    });
```

- type: String, for now 'circle' is the sample.
- size: String, the width/height of the loader.
- colors: Array with two strings - the colors for the loader.
- speed: Integer, how fast one 'spin' should last, in seconds.
- weight: String, for how thick the loader should be.
